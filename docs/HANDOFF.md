# SideKick Tidbit: current handoff

Updated: 2026-10-11 (America/New_York). Status is taken from git and `log/`; it was not re-tested today.
Location: `~/Desktop/Github/nyc-tenant-assistant-push-2`, branch `main` at `08c6790` (PR #56, 2026-10-08).

## Objective

Ship the public `/law` index page (owner chose it on 2026-10-11). Built on branch `feat/law-index`, which is stacked on `docs/agent-workflow` (PR #57) because this handoff lives there; merge #57 first. Done when the PR is merged and the live page's section count matches the library (expected about 426: 308 City, 118 State).

The workflow setup (PR #57) is still waiting for review.

## Decisions in force

- Audience is individual tenants first.
- 2026-10-01: hold new features; prioritize testing, debugging and a clean `main`.
- 2026-10-07: street + borough is the default search (exact address optional) and a read-only Resources tab is approved. Both shipped in PR #53. Community Q&A and the scaling fixes are on hold. The community board waits for a layout (posting 18+, no AI-written answers).
- 2026-10-11: `/law` index defaults approved: every section as number + title; City then State, one closed group per law; a number-only "Go to a section" box (no full-text search); repealed and dropped sections labelled, never hidden; linked from the section page and Resources, not the header nav.
- 2026-10-08: the owner adopted the Codex review pass, including the privacy line "Your details stay confidential. Used for your account."

## Recently completed

PRs #53, #55 and #56 (street lookup and Resources; case workspace and reviewed RA-81 drafts; migration names matched to live versions). The legal library is live with a quarterly refresh. Details: `log/2026-10-07-*`, `log/2026-10-08-*`.

## Environment (owner's Mac, observed 2026-10-11)

- `venv/bin/python` runs Python 3.12.15 (it follows Homebrew's `python@3.12`; `venv/pyvenv.cfg` still records 3.12.2 from creation). Flask, Supabase, Flask-Limiter, Flask-WTF and cryptography import. That's dependency discovery, not a test result.
- Claude Code 2.1.220 is installed. Reading `AGENTS.md` directly needs 2.1.277+, so keep the `CLAUDE.md` import.

## Verification

- Full suite on the Mac, 2026-10-11: **886 OK (1 skipped)** on `docs/agent-workflow` (`1f8a682`), **908 OK (1 skipped)** on `feat/law-index`.
- `/law` index: rendered locally with a faked library (light/dark, 1280 px and a 390 px frame). Live library counted read-only: 426 sections in 11 laws. Not yet opened on Render; keyboard use not driven by hand. Details: `log/2026-10-11-law-index.txt`.
- Workflow setup (2026-10-11): changes agent instructions, docs, two Python comments/docstrings and one workflow notice string; app logic is unchanged. Checks: the two Python files compile, the workflow YAML parses, no stale `docs/HANDOFF.md` references, `git diff --check` passes. The test suite was not run for it.

## Unresolved

- Owner items from the old checklist, not confirmed done: add GitHub secret `NYSENATE_API_KEY` (until then the quarterly refresh skips state law), and run the post-deploy checks on Render (sign-up with `password` is refused; one real `/building` lookup works).
- A brand-new database can't be built from `supabase/migrations/` alone: the original conversations/messages tables predate tracked migrations. Fixing this is separate engineering work; it would remove the need for live-DB migration tests.
- The live library holds Real Property Law `233-b*2` (Campgrounds), which the `/law/<citation>` number pattern rejects (404). The index lists it without a link. Owner decision: widen the pattern, or leave it.
- Not yet confirmed in a live session: that Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md` and the imported `AGENTS.md` here (check once with `/memory` in Claude Code started in this folder).

## Pending changes (workflow setup, 2026-10-11, uncommitted; replace with the PR link once merged)

- New `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (imports it); this file rewritten.
- Old handoff renamed to `docs/legal-library-record.md` (marked historical); its six references repointed.

## Next action

1. Owner: review and merge PR #57 (workflow setup), then the `/law` index PR.
2. After deploy: open `/law` on Render, confirm it says 426 sections and that a group opens and "Go to a section" works by keyboard.
3. Confirm or close the owner items above, then set the next objective here.
